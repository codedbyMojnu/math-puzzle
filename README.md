### âœ… When to Use `PUT` vs `PATCH` in This Profile Dashboard:

| Situation                                                                           | Method      | Why                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ðŸ”„ **Update the whole profile** at once (e.g., after clicking "Save" on the form)   | **`PUT`**   | You're replacing the entire profile object with the updated version       |
| ðŸ§© **Update one field at a time** (e.g., inline editing of just the email or phone) | **`PATCH`** | You're modifying only a part of the object, not replacing the whole thing |

---

### In Your Case (Editable Dashboard Form)

You're allowing the user to:

- Edit all fields together âœ…
- Click **Save** once âœ…
- Submit the **entire form data as one object** âœ…

### âœ… So, `PUT` is the right method.

```js
// Example PUT request after form submission
fetch("/api/users/1", {
  method: "PUT",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify(fullUserObject),
});
```

---

If later you build a feature where the user can **click "edit" beside just one field** and save that alone â€” then yes, use `PATCH`.
